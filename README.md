# excursions

An assignment from the Codeacademy Pro course to understand a project's workflow. We build a webpage. Then use Git to upload iterations of the project. The webpage will become a Git Page. A Git Page will illustrate to stakeholders
how the webpage will look and function. Comments and edits welcome based on content of Git Page of project.
